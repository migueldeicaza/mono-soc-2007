	* committed/xsp-vhost-fix.patch: MOVED to committed.

	* xsp-baserequestbroker-docs-plus-dont-reassign-buffer.patch: ADDED.
	Complete documentation for BaseRequestBroker.cs. In addition, it does a
	small fix that should marginally improve performance.
	
	Before the patch, when a request is unregistered, the buffer is not
	freed but cleared, presumable so it can be used again. However, when a
	requests is assigned, a new buffer is unconditionally created. This
	patch checks for a valid buffer before overwriting.
