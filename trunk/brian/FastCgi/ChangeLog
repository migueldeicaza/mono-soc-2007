	* FastCgi/Structures/NameValuePair.cs: Reworked NameValuePair to support
	a user specified encoding. Moved the parsing of collection to internal
	"static IDictionary FromData (byte [] data)". Added support for
	rendering a collection.
	
	* FastCgi/Connection.cs: Added support for rejecting requests if too
	many are occuring simulaneously. Added support for "FCGI_GET_VALUES"
	requests. Inform the server when a request has been completed. Prevent
	accepting requests if the maximum number of requests has been reached.
	
	* FastCgi/Main.cs: Use new server specific API for registering the
	responder.
	
	* FastCgi/Servers/Server.cs: Added support for limiting connections and
	requests, and enabling/disabling multiplexing. Added support for FastCGI
	style server.GetValues. Prevent accepting if the maximum number of
	connections has been reached. Moved responder registration from
	ResponderRequest to allow for per-server responders.
	
	* FastCgi/Requests/Request.cs: Replaced name/value parsing with 
	NameValuePair.FromData.
