2007-05-30  Jeff Tickle  <jeff at jeff tickle dot com>  0.1.2

	Imported into mono-soc-2007 Subversion and picked an arbitrary version
	number that indicates there has been one release and two significant
	updates since that release; those updates would be pressure sensitivity
	and the abstracting of the Stroke classes.
