	colors.

	* src/VirtualPaperUI.cs: Made into a proper GNOME Application, using
	Gnome.App and Gnome.Program rather than justGtk.Window

	* src/VirtualPaperUI.cs:
	* src/Handwritings.cs: Added support for pen styles (color and size)

	In this revision, the namespace changed from Tablet to VirtualPaper.  This
	should probably be reviewed at some point, as the widget should be under
	something like Gtk.Tablet, whereas the rest of the interface should be
	part of the namespace VirtualPaper.  I shall need to talk to my mentor who
	is much more versed in the ways of the Mono to help me out with this.

	* src/HandwritingWindow.cs: File and Class renamed to VirtualPaper.

	* src/Handwriting.cs:
	* src/Paper.cs:
	* src/NotebookPaper.cs:
	* src/VirtualPaper.cs: Abstracted out Paper support.  The drawing of the
	widget's background is now handled by subclasses of the VirtualPaper.Paper
	class.

	Imported into mono-soc-2007 Subversion and picked an arbitrary version
	number that indicates there has been one release and two significant
	updates since that release; those updates would be pressure sensitivity
	and the abstracting of the Stroke classes.
